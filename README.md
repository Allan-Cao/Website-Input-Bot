# Website Input Bot

## Purpose:

One day, in my spam email, I came across a message from "Spotify" claiming that my account had been suspended. I don't have a Spotify account so I curiously click on the link. Another fake website...

## What is this?

This is a quick program I wrote to spam fake websites with fake input to shut down their scam! This program entered about 50 fake credentials before the scammers shut down their website!

## Setup:

NOTE: program fake.py is an example
program scam.py is a bare-bone template.

Change lines 20-72 to suit your needs.
Inspect element and select the input box. 

'''
driver.find_element_by_name(" INSERT THE NAME OF THE ELEMENT HERE")
'''

'''
driver.find_element_by_id(" INSERT THE NAME OF THE ELEMENT HERE")
'''

As well, change the submit buttons to suit your needs.
## Requirements:
Selenium
Faker
Python 3.6
Chrome web driver for Selenium

## Usage:

'''
Python fake.py
'''
